# qr_code_generator_python



This Python QR Code Generator is a simple yet powerful project that allows users to create QR codes with ease. The project consists of two scripts, each with a different level of customization for the generated QR codes.

1. qr_code.py: This script is a basic QR code generator that takes a given URL (in this case, a YouTube video link) and creates a QR code with default settings. The generated QR code is then saved as a PNG file.

2. qr_code1.py: This script offers more advanced customization options for the generated QR code. It allows users to define QR code parameters such as version, error_correction, box_size, and border. Additionally, the script enables the customization of fill and back colors for the QR code. Like the basic generator, the resulting QR code is saved as a PNG file.

This project is a perfect starting point for those who want to create and customize QR codes for various purposes. It can be easily extended to accept user input or integrate with other applications, making it a versatile and valuable tool for developers and end-users alike.

To use the scripts, simply download the required dependencies, adjust the input URL as needed, and run the appropriate script. Your custom QR code will be generated and saved as a PNG file in the same directory as the script.
